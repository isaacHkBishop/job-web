                    <h1>Demand & Job Market Outlook</h1>
                    <li>
                        The overall demand for network/network-operations/network-engineer
                        jobs in the U.S. remains positive
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        According to one estimate, there are tens of thousands of active job openings for network engineer
                        / network operations roles nationwide
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Growth projections: for roles roughly in the “network administrator / network engineer / network operations” space, employment growth is projected to be about 
                        5% over a decade (e.g. 2018–2028) — roughly average compared to all occupations
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For more senior/architect-level roles — e.g. Computer Network Architects — 
                        growth is stronger: projected ~12% growth from 2024–2034
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Underlying drivers: as companies continue to expand and secure their IT infrastructure — including cloud adoption, increased data flow, remote work, 
                        cybersecurity needs — demand for experienced network professionals remains significant
                    </li>

                    <h1>Challenges & what to Watch Out For</h1>
                    <li>
                        Not all “network engineer” jobs are equal — titles and responsibilities vary. 
                        Some roles might just be basic administration/support, which are lower-paying
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The pay range is broad. Without specialization or 
                        experience, you may end up in lower-paying roles
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The job market can feel competitive and at times unpredictable — some professionals (on forums) report slow hiring or 
                        difficulty getting callbacks even with good credentials (especially if they try to enter the market mid-career or after layoffs)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        As infrastructure shifts (cloud, automation), some traditional networking tasks evolve 
                        — meaning ongoing learning is often required.
